📊 About the Dataset – California House Price Prediction

🏡 Context
The California Housing dataset is a well-known dataset derived from the 1990 U.S. Census data, used extensively for regression tasks in machine learning 🧠. It was originally published by Pace and Barry and is now a standard benchmark dataset available in the Scikit-learn library.

The objective is to predict the median house value in different districts of California based on various socio-economic and geographical features. 💰📍
